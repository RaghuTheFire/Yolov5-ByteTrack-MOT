# Yolov5-ByteTrack-MOT

Implementing YOLOv5-ByteTrack for Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) involves integrating YOLOv5 for object detection and ByteTrack for object tracking. ByteTrack is a recent algorithm for object tracking that can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Below, I'll provide a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. Object Detection (YOLOv5):
  YOLOv5 is used to detect objects in each frame of the video.
  It provides bounding boxes and class probabilities for each detected object.

2. **Object Tracking (ByteTrack):**
   ByteTrack is applied to track objects across frames.
   It utilizes a lightweight deep neural network for object tracking, which is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
   ByteTrack maintains a set of tracked objects, associating detections with existing tracks or creating new tracks as necessary.

3. Integration:
   After obtaining object detections from YOLOv5, feed these detections into the ByteTrack tracker.
   ByteTrack updates its internal state and returns the IDs of tracked objects along with their bounding boxes in each frame.

4. Post-processing:
   Perform any post-processing steps such as filtering out low-confidence detections, smoothing trajectories, or handling occlusions.
